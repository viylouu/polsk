polsk is a dynamically typed garbage collected mop language  
a mop language is a mutation-oriented programming language, basically the opposite of functional programming  
it is built off of 4 types of things: values, unary operators, span operators, and infix operators.  
infix operators are a special type of operator that does stuff based off of 2 different values  
span operators are another special type of operator that contains a group of items with certain rules, that ends at the first invalid case
